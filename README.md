# Library App

I created this single-page application as a learning exercise. It demonstrates my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript. The user can add a new book to the "Currently Reading" section, which will push any other books to "Previously Read." The user can input an image URL from a site such as Goodreads to display alongside the book information.
